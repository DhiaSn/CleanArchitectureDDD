## Introduction
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that prioritizes the modeling of the business domain to create a flexible and maintainable codebase. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of DDD principles in an ASP.NET API, showcasing how the codebase can evolve with the business requirements.

## Features
- **Modularity:** The codebase is organized into distinct modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the business domain.
- **Separation of Concerns:** DDD principles such as Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, and Repositories are implemented to ensure proper separation of concerns.
- **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to facilitate easy scalability by allowing new features to be added without significant modification of existing code.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhiaSn/CleanArchitectureDDD.git 
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

## Project Structure
The project is structured following DDD principles:

- **src:** Contains the source code of the ASP.NET API.
  - **Domain:** Core business logic and domain entities.
  - **App:** Application services and use cases.
  - **Infrastructure:** External dependencies, data access, and cross-cutting concerns.
  - **API:** 

- **tests:** Unit tests for the application.

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- Serilog
